        is from the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy written by JRR Tolkien.
        He lives in the world of Middle Earth and his hometown is the Shire. He is a
        hobbit and is tasked with the duty of protecting Frodo Baggins as he makes his
        trek towards Mordor in order to destroy the one ring. Here are some reasons why I admire this character

    <ul>
        <li>Samwise Gamgee has the best mental fortitude</li>
        <li>Without him, Frodo would've died ten thousand times</li>
        <li class="favoriteFact">The way he says "potatoes"</li>
    </ul>
